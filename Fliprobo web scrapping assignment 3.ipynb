Btw I'm 15 for those who didn't know, and yea its been a really big struggle to cope, for those wondering why I'm depressed, lets just say, I had been SEVERELY bullied, and I had been sexually abused and assaulted by my cousin growing up when i was 7-11, and the rest being at school. I had MANY traumatic events in my life, and I ended up getting into self harm and a suicide attempt in April. I'm a 1 month clean, and something I would like to tell everyone is that Suicide isnt the answer, I promise you everything will get better, trust me. Im doing better but I still am depressed every single day due to a number of reasons.\\n\\nSpreading Love and wellness to everyone, and I hope, tho those whom are struggling will finally find peace within themselves and their minds.\",\n",
